      Global application settings.
      Notice, config settings starting with a ".", are in general terms not accessible from p5.lambda directly. Which means they
      can only be retrieved from C# active events, and only if the invoker invokes the [.p5.config.get] with a period
      in front of its name!

      The above feature, allows you to create configuration settings, which cannot be read from Hyperlambda.

    <!--
        The next setting, defines how many maximum ViewState values will be stored in session for each session object.
        If your users are notified often that there was too many viewstate values for the current session, and 
        that their current ViewState key was invalidated, you might consider increasing this value. If you 
        increase it though, the amount of memory used for each session object in your application, will increase, 
        and hence the memory usage of your application will increase. A good number is probably between 5 and 10.

        If you set it to 0, then no ViewState will be stored in the session. This is a major security risk, due to
        the internals of Phosphorus Five, and how it stores p5 lambda objects for Web Widgets in the ViewState.
        If you set it to -1, then the number of ViewState objects per session becomes infinite, which is also a major
        security risk, since then any session can easily use up all memory of your server, simply by pressing reloading
        the page, thousands of times, exhausting your server's memory.

        The next setting tells Phosphorus Five which Hyperlambda file to execute during startup of your application.
        Normally this file should at the very least create one Active Event, needed as a hook, name [p5.web.load-ui].

        This Active Event is raised by Phosphorus Five during the beginning of a HTTP request, and is expected to load
        the User Interface, or do other things, dependent upon what you want it to do.

        The event will be given a [url] argument, which for the root URL will be "/".

        If you want to only use Phosphorus Five, as a full stack development framework yourself, feel free to override
        this, and create your own "loader logic".

        The default loader logic, provided out of the box with Phosphorus Five, will load a simple "desktop", which
        is basically a "micro web operating system".

        This desktop, is dependent upon Micro, which P5 will automatically download, after having brought you through
        setting up your server salt, and root password - For then to show all your installed applications, in addition to
        allowing you to automatically download and install, applications from our internal Bazar.
