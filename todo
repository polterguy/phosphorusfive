* gzip javascript files through pre-build step on Release-Linux

* create cache of MethodInfo to use in InvokeEventHandler to optimize use of reflection, and investigate if we can get completely rid 
  of reflection, since it requires "partial trust" on server, which is not supplied by all web hotels for instance

* move all public methods at the top, then all protected, then all private methods, in all classes, and check up the dox for all methods

* make sure script inclusions by default don't mess up spacing in html filter

* modify readme to have fully functioning complete example of Default.aspx page, with complete codebehind, and complete .aspx markup

* create support for "array" pf.lambda type, which allows to be used as an expression for Expression.Iterate, such that
  users may submit a static array of values to stuff such as "for-each", "pf.web.session.set", etc

* create "plugin" support for "for-each", "set", "add" etc, to allow iterating for instance Widgets, and change their properties
  directly to create less verbose code

* clean up [pf.html.html2lambda] to allow creating pf.lambda code in HTML

* [flatten] keyword in pf.lambda, to create a string representation of a list of nodes, with optional "separator string"
  between node values/names, possibly as a "formatting expression" defined e.g. like this; "{name}:{value};" to allow for both
  name of node and value of node to become part of string representation

* [split] keyword in pf.lambda, to create node list representation of a string, according to some "split character", 
  and optionally a "name split character" to allow for both name and value of node to be set according to the original 
  string, in addition to optionally also "type information"

* store timezone (GTM+x) in DateTime when serializing and de-serializing from Hyperlisp

* Active Event to zip many CSS/JavaScript files back to client as one, relying on [pf.web.echo]

* create support for "style" property setters/getters in widgets through pf.lambda optionally can take a list of style names/values, instead
  of like it is now where it's "just a string"

* "math" Active Events, taking expressions, evaluating these, and [add], [subtract], [multiply] and [divide]'ing these

* create [insert] keyword that allows inserting nodes at a specific position in tree

* Exception hierarchy

* reference nodes in Hyperlisp, where value is an expression, leading to a node, such that values of nodes, can reference
  another node in Hyperlisp as an expression, allowing for "late binding" after Nodes are created, maybe ...?

* finish up comments on Unit Tests, class "Core" for instance

* [context-event] and [context-override] keywords, with associated [context-delete-event] and [context-delete-override] keywords
  I don't think we need this, but keep it in TODO for a while ...

* create consistency between all Active events using only ONE of "remove" or "delete". [pf.data.delete] might possibly be 
  [remove] instead, the same with [pf.folder.remove], [pf.file.remove], etc ...

* investigate [pf.data.update] to see if it's even necessary

* finish up MongoDB plugin ...

* Comet (LazyHttp) support

* "indent", "de-indent" and "quote string" helper buttons in pf.lambda executor in System42

* [lambda2html] Active Event

* support for loading and saving binary files

* [zip] and [unzip] Active Events

* more [crypto] features

* [MIME] wrapper, for being able to transmit and read MIME messages to other servers

* make it possible to store both Session, and ViewState, in MongoDB, and/or other database implementations

* create META support for retrieving XML comments from Active Events

* create support for retrieving body (lambda objects) of dynamically create Active Events

* clean up all [pw.web.session/application/etc] to make sure EVERYTHING can somehow be returned back to client as node, or something ...?
  and that their API conforms to each other

* support for storing stuff in ViewState, like Session and Application

* finish up [pw.web.post] to POST requests towards URLs

* make sure [set] can set 'value' and 'name' when source leads to multiple nodes, and create unit test for it

* [rel-source] on [pf.web.session.set] and friends

* more unit tests for [rel-source] on set and friends

* make sure none of the iterators are throwing null reference exceptions, trying to access a null object, but instead ends iteration

* make sure [sys42.show-tree] can "append more results" to itself, such that it keeps the same dialogue for multiple invocations
  during the same, and consecutive request

* make support for [rel-source] in [pf.web.return-value]

* plugin architecture for creating custom iterators, both using C# and in pf.lambda

* "-1" property for ViewStateInSession property, to allow "infinite" number of ViewState keys in Session object, with a BIG warning
  to user that this posess a security risk though!
